### **HousePrice_Analysis**

- Project Background:

  The primary goal of the House Price Analysis project is to develop a robust model that can systematically analyze various factors influencing house prices in different areas. By leveraging Python for data visualization and analysis, the project aims to provide
  insights into the key variables affecting property values and determine reasonable pricing based on prevailing conditions.

- Key Tasks:

  1. Data Collection:
  
     - Gather comprehensive datasets containing information on real estate transactions, property characteristics, and
       neighborhood attributes.
     - Ensure data integrity and cleanliness for accurate analysis.

  2. Data Preprocessing:

     - Handle missing/errors (NA, null, duplicates) data by imputing values or removing observations as appropriate.
     - Perform any additional data cleaning and transformation steps to prepare the dataset for modeling.

  3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
     
     - Utilize Python for exploratory data analysis to uncover patterns, trends, and potential outliers in the data
       set.
     - Identify relevent features that significantly impact house prices.

  4. Formulate Hypothesis

     - Develop hypotheses regarding the relationship between specific features and house prices.
     - Drawing on domain knowledge and insights gained during the exploratory data analysis, we will articulate
       specific assumptions about how certain factors influence property values. These hypotheses will serve as the
       foundation for hypothesis testing and historical data analysis.

  5. Pricing + Geospatial Analysis and Visualization:

     - Utilize Python's data visualization librabries to create insightful charts and graphs.
     - Illustrate the relationships between various factors and their impact on house prices.
     - Leverage hypotheses testing and historical data analysis to validate or refute assumptions.

- Tools and Technologies:

  - Python for data analysis, visualization.
  - Jupyter Notebooks for interactive development and documentation.
 
- Expected Outcomes:

  The House Price Analysis project aims to deliver a comprehensive and user-friendly tool for understanding and
  estimating property values. By incorporating advanced analytics and visualization techniques, the project seeks
  to empower users with valuable insights into the complex dynamics that influence house prices in different areas.
